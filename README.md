# EmpaChat

With EmpaChat we intend to make chat communication and interactions online as close to reality as possible. Most of real-time communication happens non-verbally, thus we decided to tackle this problem through the addition of multiple layers to online communication.

So far we implemented two main features:

Real-Time Text Display

This feature allows the user to see what the participants of the chat rooms are typing in real time. We believe that this gives the participants a deeper insight into the thought processes of their friends or opponents. Just like in real life you canâ€™t just take something back as soon as you said it.

Facial Expression Recognition

Our second feature uses the front camera to analyse the facial expressions while typing. When the messages get sent they will be displayed in the color and with an emoji that matches your mood whilst writing said message. This allows the participants to understand the exact emotions of others.

With our features you also don't have to rely on your memory, therefore you can analyze the conversation afterwards and pick up on elements you might would have missed otherwise. Especially for people that have a hard time understanding emotions or facial expressions this could be a door-opener.

In the long run, we hope our technology will impact our online behaviour. Hopefully it will change the way we interact online and make it a more interactive and empathic space!
