# EmpaChat

With EmpaChat we intend to make chat-communication and Interactions online as close to reality as possible. Most of real time communication happens non-verbally we tackle this problem by adding multiple layers to online communication.

So far implemented two main features:

Real time text display

This feature allows the user to see what the participants of the chatrooms are typing in real time. We believe that this gives the participants a deeper insight into the thought processes. Exactly like in real life you canâ€™t just take something back as soon as you said it.

Facial Expression reader

Our second feature uses the front-camera to analyse the facial expressions while typing. When the messages get sent they will be displayed in the color and with an emoji that matches your mood whilst writing it . This allows the participants to understand the exact emotions of the others.

Additionally because with our features you don't have to rely on your memory, you can also analyze the conversation afterwards and pick up elements you might would have missed otherwise. We think especially for people that have a hard time understanding emotions or facial expressions this could be a door-opener.

In the long run we hope technology like this one will impact our online behaviour! Hopefully it will change the way we interact online and make it a more interactive and empathic space!
